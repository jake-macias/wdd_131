        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>
            The purpose of RecipeFinder is to help users discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have at home. 
            It allows people to search, filter, and explore meals that fit their preferences or dietary needs while cutting down on food waste.

        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>
            RecipeFinder is designed for home cooks, college students, and busy individuals who want to prepare easy and affordable meals. 
            It is especially useful for people who don’t have time to scroll through long recipe blogs and just want quick, useful ideas.
        </p>

        <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
        <p>
            JavaScript will power a live recipe search and filtering system. Users can type in ingredients, select cuisine types, or apply dietary filters such as vegetarian or gluten-free. 
            The site will display recipe cards that update instantly as filters change. There will also be a “Recipe of the Day” section that rotates daily using JavaScript date logic.
